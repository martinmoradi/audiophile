- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: Vercel Postgres
- **ORM**: Drizzle
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Authentication**: To be implemented (planned: Next-Auth)
- **State Management**: TBD (possibly React Context or Zustand)
- **Testing**:
  - Unit: Vitest
  - E2E: Playwright
- **Deployment**: Vercel
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry
- **Analytics**: PostHog
- **Rate Limiting**: Upstash Redis
- **Internationalization**: Next.js i18n

## Project Structure

- Using Next.js 14+ App Router
- `/src/app`: Main application code
- `/src/components`: Reusable React components
- `/src/server`: Server-side code, including database schema
- `/src/styles`: Global styles and Tailwind configuration

## Website Content and Structure

### Home Page

1. **Navigation Bar**: Links to product categories and cart
2. **Hero Section**: Showcasing a new product with a visually appealing gradient background
3. **Category Cards**: Three cards linking to Headphones, Speakers, and Earphones categories
4. **Featured Products Section**: Various sized cards with carefully chosen images, linking to individual products
5. **About Section**: Explanation of the shop's core values and procedures
6. **Footer**: Additional navigation and information

### Category Pages (Headphones, Speakers, Earphones)

- Display product cards for each category
- Each card links to an individual product page
- Initially includes 3 headphones, 2 speakers, and 1 earphone product

### Product Pages

- Detailed product images
- Product features and specifications
- Add to cart functionality
- Additional product details

### Shopping Cart

- Display added items
- Update quantities
- Remove items
- Proceed to checkout

### Checkout Page

- Multi-step checkout process
- Form for shipping and payment information
- Integration with payment gateway (planned: Stripe)
- Order confirmation modal upon completion

### Responsive Design

- Layouts optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

## Key Features to Implement

1. Product catalog with categories (headphones, speakers, earphones)
2. Individual product pages with detailed information
3. Shopping cart functionality
4. Checkout process with payment integration
5. User authentication (to be implemented later)
6. Admin panel for product and order management
7. Internationalization (English and French)

## Database Schema (Initial)

- Products
- Categories
- Orders
- (Other tables as needed)

## Authentication

- To be implemented later (planned: Next-Auth)
- Will include protected routes for user-specific and admin functionalities

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests with Vitest
- E2E tests with Playwright
- Continuous Integration with GitHub Actions

## Deployment

- Deployment on Vercel
- Environment variables management
- Production, staging, and development environments

## Performance Considerations

- Image optimization with next/image
- Lazy loading of components
- Server-side rendering and static generation where appropriate

## SEO Optimization

- Dynamic meta tags
- Sitemap generation
- Schema markup for products

## Accessibility

- ARIA attributes
- Keyboard navigation
- Color contrast adherence

## Security Measures

- Input sanitization
- CORS policies
- Rate limiting with Upstash Redis

## Development Workflow

- Git branching strategy (TBD)
- Pre-commit hooks with Husky
- Code formatting with Prettier
- Linting with ESLint

## Current Status

- Project initialized with Next.js and TypeScript
- Initial database schema created with Drizzle ORM

## Next Steps

- Implement UI components based on the design
- Set up database connections
- Create product catalog functionality
